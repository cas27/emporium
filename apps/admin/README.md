# Emporium Admin

To start your Admin app:

  1. First make sure you've started Emporium API
  2. Make sure your `config/dev.exs` points to the right API server.  (http://localhost:4000 is default)
  3. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  4. Install front end dependencies with `npm install`
  5. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4001`](http://localhost:4001) from your browser.
